# Changelog Maintenance

This rule applies to [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:CHANGELOG.md)

## How to Maintain Our Changelog

Our project follows the [Keep a Changelog](mdc:https:/keepachangelog.com) format. Follow these guidelines when making changes:

### When to Update

- Add entries to the "Unreleased" section **as you make changes** - don't wait until release time
- Each PR should include changelog updates relevant to the changes being made
- Move "Unreleased" changes to a versioned section when creating a release
- Add new changes at the top of the file

### Formatting Guidelines

- Group changes by type:
  - **Added**: New features
  - **Changed**: Changes to existing functionality
  - **Deprecated**: Soon-to-be removed features
  - **Removed**: Removed features
  - **Fixed**: Bug fixes
  - **Security**: Vulnerability fixes
- Be concise but descriptive
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Group related changes under sub-bullets when appropriate
- Keep user perspective in mind - focus on impact, not implementation

### Versioning

- Follow [Semantic Versioning](mdc:https:/semver.org) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- During initial development (0.y.z): increment minor for significant changes
- Include the release date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Example Process

1. Make code changes
2. Add descriptive entry to "Unreleased" section
3. When releasing:
   - Move "Unreleased" items to new versioned section
   - Set the version number and date
   - Create new empty "Unreleased" section

### Good Example
